    "content": "For example, in single cell DNA methylome analysis, a typical approach is to merge the CG sites into a fixed window size bin because of high sparsity levels of the data. To do that, we can download the Win100k.20220228.cm file from KYCG_mm10, and then run the following . yame summary -m Win100k.20220228.cm single_cell.cg . The ouput will look something like this .
